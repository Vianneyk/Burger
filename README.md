# BURGER

This project is a full stack application that allows you to place an order for a burger. When you place an order, the burger you enter in the form field is added to the list of "Ready To Eat Burger" on the left side of the screen. Each burger in the list has a <b>Devour it</b> button. Clicking this button moves the burger from the list on the left side of the screen to the list on the right. The list on the right is a list of burgers that have already been devoured. 

This project uses MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars, ORM (Object Relational Mapper). Node and MySQL are used to query and route data in the application. Express is the backend web framework used for this application, and Handlebars is a templating language that is used to generate the HTML.
